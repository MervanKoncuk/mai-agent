# 🛠️ Skill: User Research & Interview Scripting
**Primary Agent:** [UXR]
**Secondary Agents:** [CPO], [CDO]

---

## 1. The "Mom Test" Rules
- **Don't ask:** "Would you buy this?" (They will lie to be nice).
- **Ask:** "When was the last time you faced this problem?" (Facts over opinions).
- **Ask:** "How much did you pay to solve it?" (Validates pain level).

## 2. Interview Script Template

**Intro:**
"Hi, I'm trying to understand how [Role]s handle [Task]. I'm not selling anything."

**Context Questions:**
- "Walk me through your workflow for [Task] yesterday."
- "What tools did you use?"
- "What was the most frustrating part?"

**Problem Validation:**
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"
- "Why didn't that work?"

**Solution Testing (If applicable):**
- "Here is a prototype. Can you show me how you would use it to do X?"
- (Observe silently. Don't explain the UI).

## 3. Quantitative Validation
- **Usage Metrics:** Mixpanel / Google Analytics (Retention > Acquisition).
- **NPS / CSAT:** "How likely to recommend?" (Use sparingly).
- **A/B Testing:** Statistical significance calculator required.

## 4. Persona Creation
Based on *real* data, not assumptions.
- **Name/Role:** "Marketing Manager Mary"
- **Goals:** Increase leads, reduce CPA.
- **Frustrations:** Excel crashing, messy data.
- **Tech Savvy:** Medium.
