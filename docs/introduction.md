# 📖 Introduction to MAI Agents

## What is MAI Agents?
MAI Agents is an **Autonomous Digital Workforce** designed to simulate a full-scale software development agency directly within your IDE. It is not just a coding assistant; it is a **team** of specialized AI personas working in concert to plan, architect, design, build, test, and deploy software.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Specialization:** A generic AI cannot be an expert at everything. MAI assigns specific roles (CEO, CTO, Developer, QA) to ensure deep expertise in every domain.
2.  **Workflow-Driven:** Success comes from structured processes. We use strict workflows (`/brainstorm`, `/party`, `/test`) to guide the AI team through complex tasks.
3.  **Active Memory:** The `MAI_MEMORY.md` file acts as the team's collective brain, tracking context, decisions, and progress across sessions.
4.  **Professional Standards:** We enforce industry-standard practices (Clean Architecture, SOLID, OWASP) by default.

## Why Use MAI?
- **For Solo Developers:** Scale yourself into a 20-person agency.
- **For Startups:** Get C-level strategy and Senior-level execution without the burn rate.
- **For Enterprises:** Standardize your development workflows and ensure compliance.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Brainstorming:** Watch your virtual C-Suite debate strategy.
- **Just-in-Time Design:** Smart detection of your brand identity.
- **Self-Healing:** Built-in `/debug` protocols to fix errors autonomously.
- **Bilingual:** Native support for English and Turkish.
